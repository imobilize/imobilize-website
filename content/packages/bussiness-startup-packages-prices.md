makerting_text: "Social media marketing is the medium to promote a business, products, services, and a person using social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, and Twitter, etc. Social media marketing is a good platform for both consumers and businesses. But for businesses what matters is the content should be unique, engaging, informational, and friendly that people love to like, retweet, and share on their profile.

Social media marketing is about reaching your target audience and customers where they are and as they interact socially with each other and your brand.

While social media marketing is incredibly valuable and profitable for the growth of your business (as you will see in the following section), your strategy will vary depending on which audience your users spend their time on social networks.
