benifits_list_heading_1: "Global Access 24/7"
benifits_list_paragraph_1: "Without the internet, it is next to impossible for your business to provide its services for 24 hours. With the help of an online website, you can let your customers visit and know about your services at any time from any corner of the world. This can not be possible with an offline business. Your clients and customers can read about your products and place orders as per their convenience."
benifits_list_heading_2: "Low Operating Costs"
benifits_list_paragraph_2: " Moving your business online does not require any kind of warehouse, inventory, transportation vehicles, or staff. The shift is so smooth that all you have to do is sell the same product that you sell at your offline store to a wide base of customers."
benifits_list_heading_3: " Better Customer Support"
benifits_list_paragraph_3: "The internet was made for business and if you are an opportunist you must leverage the online world. The undeniable advantage of having an online business is that it enables you to answer queries of your customers and resolve their problems without consuming much of your time. So with the internet, you can simply have better customer support for your potential customers. What you can do is to simply create a video including instructions or a guide that can help customers get the answers to their questions."
benifits_list_heading_4: "Feasibility to Operate From Anywhere"
benifits_list_paragraph_4: "Having an online business enables you to operate and handle it from any corner of the world. This great benefit of having an online business lets you have the freedom to operate your business from anywhere by not just being stuck to a physical location."
benifits_list_heading_5: "Boundless Business"
benifits_list_paragraph_5: "your online business is having the whole world as its audience. In case you don’t want to sell your products to a global audience due to increased shipping costs or any other reason, you can still continue to deliver your services across your country."
benifits_list_heading_6: "Unlimited income potential"
benifits_list_paragraph_6: "With one traditional job comes a single salary. With an online business comes unlimited income potential. As an employee, you can’t control how much you get paid and the chances of your income going up are at the discretion of your employer. And if you’re lucky to get a raise it will normally be very little."
