content3: "Developers at iMobilize have specialized in mobile software for many years and during this time we have witnessed many changes to this fast-moving and exciting industry. The mobile software industry really gathered pace after the initial launch of the first smartphones resulting in explosive growth and a fragmented ecosystem with many platforms to build software applications. Today there are 2 clear winners; Android and iOS who together dominate the mobile apps market with more than 90% of the entire market share between them.

Our Specialists move with the market and there are many solutions our clients adopt to create applications across various mobile platforms and web browsers accessible on the many devices in the market today. Some clients seek Consultancy advice on how best to drive and deliver their mobile products to market. As such we do provide experienced Consultants who can implement strategy, advise on direction and analyse requirements."

process: "Every business is built on one thing and one thing only – it’s ability to generate revenue…
…And revenue is largely based on the ability to get customers. 
Generating customers is also the #1 expense a business will incur in it’s quest for growth….
…That’s why we developed the Startup model to allow you to attract prospective customers automatically…
…And then turn those customers into loyal fans that buy from you on repeat."
