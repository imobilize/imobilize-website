process: "iMobilize was part of the team that built the Sky Go iOS app. This award winning mobile app allows a Sky customer to watch the shows they know and love wherever and whenever they want. Some of the technical challenges included DRM (Digital Rights Management) protection of the content, applying business rules around content entitlements, reliability of the video stream over poor network connections all while providing a good user interface and seamless user experience. Some of the mobile app features include: 
<br>
<br>– Download selected On Demand content depending on your Sky TV subscription to PC, Mac, iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad
