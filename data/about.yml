    content : "A product launch is a marketing strategy comprised of a precisely planned sequence of events that aim to make a buzz for the release and make as much sales as possible in a short time period. We create the initial buzz by spreading awareness through making use of social media in a effort to maximise the number of potential consumers pre-launch. The promotion is kept alive post-launch by sending out follow up messages, giving clients a re-run of all that happened during the launch."
